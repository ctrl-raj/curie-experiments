# Curie & Maaya: Fine-tuned LLMs with Dual Personalities

## Project Description

This project explores the fascinating world of AI personalities through two distinct fine-tuned models: **Curie** and **Maaya**. Curie delivers sharp, sarcastic roasts, while Maaya brings a playful and flirty charm to every interaction. Beyond their unique conversational styles, this project pushes the boundaries of user experience by providing responses in natural-sounding speech via the {Link: Edge-TTS service https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts}.

## Features

*   **Distinct AI Personalities:**
    *   **Curie:**  Our resident roasting expert, ready with witty and sarcastic remarks.
    *   **Maaya:** A charming and flirty AI companion designed for playful interactions.
*   **Speech Output (TTS):**  All AI responses are delivered in high-quality speech, making interactions more engaging and accessible. This feature leverages the power of {Link: Edge-TTS https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts}.
*   **Fine-Tuned on Mistral:** The core language model for both personalities has been fine-tuned on the powerful Mistral architecture, ensuring robust and contextually relevant responses.

## Current Development

*   **Speech Input:** We are actively working on implementing speech input capabilities, allowing for hands-free and more natural conversational flows.

## Getting Started

*(This section will be expanded as your project progresses and includes installation instructions, usage examples, etc. For now, it's a placeholder.)*

## Roadmap

*   Implement robust speech input for seamless conversational experiences.
*   Explore new personality traits and expand the range of interaction styles.
*   Integrate with various platforms for broader accessibility.
*   Continue refining the Mistral fine-tuning for improved performance and nuanced responses.
