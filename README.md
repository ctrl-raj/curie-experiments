# Curie & Maaya: Fine-tuned AI Personalities

## About This Project

This is a project that fine-tunes the Mistral LLM to create two distinct AI personalities:

*   **Curie:** A sassy AI, offering roasts and witty banter.
*   **Maaya:** A charming AI, for playful flirting.

Speech output has been added using the {Link: Edge-TTS service https://github.com/rany2/edge-tts} so each AI has a unique voice.

## What's Inside

*   **Personality Models:** The models are fine-tuned on Mistral to bring Curie and Maaya to life.
*   **Speech Output:** Edge-TTS is used to give each AI a distinct voice.
*   **Current Development:**  Speech input is currently being added to allow for direct conversation.
